## Resolve issues signing in to Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal
If your work or school purchases subscriptions through Volume Licensing or the Visual Studio Marketplace, they are managed by administrators.  There are two types:
•	Administrators (admins) can assign, edit, and delete subscriptions.
•	Super Admins can perform the same functions as admins as well as set preferences for agreements and appoint other administrators and Super Admins.  

**Common sign-in issues**
If you’re an administrator and you can’t access the subscriptions administration portal at https://manage.visualstudio.com, the email address you’re using to sign in to the portal may be incorrect.  Contact your Super Admin to correct the problem.  If you're not sure who your Super Admins are, any admin on the agreement can provide you with that information.  It's listed in the **Agreement details**, which can be accessed using the second button from the top on the left side of the portal.

**Use Contact my Admin**
If you also have a subscription assigned, you can access the **Contact my Admin** feature in the Visual Studio subscriptions portal to send a message to your admins and Super Admins.  (Your Super Admins determine who receives these messages.)

If you’re not able to contact a Super Admin, you may need to contact your procurement organization.  The Primary Contact and Notices Contact on Visual Studio subscriptions agreements are automatically listed as Super Admins, and they can assist you.  It is recommended that multiple Super Admins be listed so that one person leaving your organization doesn’t leave you with no Super Admins.

**Can't see subscriptions after signing in?**
If you’re able to log into the portal but can’t find the subscriptions you want to manage, it’s possible you are an admin on more than one agreement, and you’re currently viewing the wrong one.  To switch agreements, locate the drop-down list in the upper left corner, and select the desired agreement.
