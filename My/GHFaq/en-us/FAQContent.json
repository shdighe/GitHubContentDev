		"ans":"Adding an alternate account to your Visual Studio subscription allows you to access the subscription benefits, like Azure DevOps and Azure,            with a different identity than that which the subscription is assigned to. In the past, this functionality was available only if your Visual Studio (VS) subscription was assigned to a Microsoft Account (MSA).            We have extended this functionality for work or school accounts in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).            <div class='clear'></div>            This doesn’t provide a copy of subscription to the other account; it only provides the ability to access the two benefits with the alternate account.             <div class='clear'></div>            For all subscriptions, you can add a 'work or school account' so you can use that account with your benefits that require a login (VS IDE, Azure DevOps, and Azure).             <div class='clear'></div>            Adding an alternate ID is easy.  Connect to <a href='https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions' target='_blank'>https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions</a>, click on 'Add alternate account', enter the email address and click 'Add'.
